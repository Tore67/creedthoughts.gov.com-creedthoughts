        <p>Just found out today is a Monday. Thought it was Thursday all morning. No wonder no one was at trivia night. 
        
        Also, someone left a half-eaten sandwich in the fridge. I took it. Finders keepers.</p>

        <p>Meredith is acting like she’s been here forever. I swear I just met her last week. She says she’s worked here for years, but I have my doubts. 
        
        In other news, I may have accidentally sold some printer toner to a guy who wasn’t looking for printer toner. Not my problem anymore.</p>

        <p>Got lost on my way to work today. Ended up at a bowling alley. Decided to roll a few frames. Won a tournament. Didn’t make it to work. 
        
        Also, I think someone stole my chair at the office. Either that or I forgot where I sit.</p>

        <p>They had a barbecue at work today. I took three hot dogs, and no one noticed. That’s a new record for me. 
        
        Also, I found a set of keys in the parking lot. If no one claims them by tomorrow, I guess I own a Honda now.</p>

        <p>Stanley was asleep at his desk again. Respect. Man knows how to pace himself. 
        
        Someone put up a birthday sign in the breakroom. I took some cake. No clue whose birthday it was. Might have been mine.</p>

        <h2>December 12, 2014</h2>
        <p>People keep telling me Vine is the future. I prefer smoke signals. You ever try sending a six-second message with fire? That’s real talent. 
        
        Found a wallet in the parking lot. Inside: $43, an expired gym membership, and a receipt for something called “beet vodka.” Thanks, universe.</p>
